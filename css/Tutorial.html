     <p>The term &quot;Artificial neural network&quot; refers to a biologically inspired sub-field of
        artificial intelligence modeled after the brain. An Artificial neural network is
        usually a computational network based on biological neural networks that
        construct the structure of the human brain. Similar to a human brain has
        neurons interconnected to each other, artificial neural networks also have
        neurons that are linked to each other in various layers of the networks. These
        neurons are known as nodes.</p>

        <p>The term &quot;Artificial Neural Network&quot; is derived from Biological neural
            networks that develop the structure of a human brain. Similar to the human
            brain that has neurons interconnected to one another, artificial neural
            networks also have neurons that are interconnected to one another in various
            layers of the networks. These neurons are known as nodes.</p>

        <p>An &quot;Artificial Neural Network&quot;n the field of Artificial intelligence where it
            attempts to mimic the network of neurons makes up a human brain so that
            computers will have an option to understand things and make decisions in a
            human-like manner. The artificial neural network is designed by programming
            computers to behave simply like interconnected brain cells.</p>

                There are around 1000 billion neurons in the human brain. Each neuron has
                an association point somewhere in the range of 1,000 and 100,000. In the
                human brain, data is stored in such a manner as to be distributed, and we can
                extract more than one piece of this data when necessary from our memory
                parallel. We can say that the human brain is made up of incredibly amazing
                parallel processors.

                We can understand the artificial neural network with an example, consider an
                example of a digital logic gate that takes an input and gives an output. &quot;OR&quot;
                gate, which takes two inputs. If one or both the inputs are &quot;On,&quot; then we get
                &quot;On&quot; in output. If both the inputs are &quot;Off,&quot; then we get &quot;Off&quot; in output. Here
                the output depends upon input. Our brain does not perform the same task.
                The outputs to inputs relationship keep changing because of the neurons in
                our brain, which are &quot;learning.&quot;

        <h2 id="a1">The architecture of an artificial neural network:</h2>
        <p>To understand the concept of the architecture of an artificial neural network,
            we have to understand what a neural network consists of. In order to define a
            neural network that consists of a large number of artificial neurons, which are
            termed units arranged in a sequence of layers. Lets us look at various types of
            layers available in an artificial neural network.</p>

        <p><b>Input Layer:</b></p>
        <p>As the name suggests, it accepts inputs in several different formats provided
            by the programmer.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
        <p><b>Output Layer:</b></p>
        <p>The input goes through a series of transformations using the hidden layer,
            which finally results in output that is conveyed using this layer.
            The artificial neural network takes input and computes the weighted sum of
            the inputs and includes a bias. This computation is represented in the form of
            a transfer function.It determines weighted total is passed as an input to an activation function to
            produce the output. Activation functions choose whether a node should fire or
            not. Only those who are fired make it to the output layer. There are distinctive
            activation functions available that can be applied upon the sort of task we are
            performing.

        <h2 id="a1">How do artificial Neural Network works?</h2>
        <p>Afterward, each of the input is multiplied by its corresponding weights ( these
            weights are the details utilized by the artificial neural networks to solve a
            specific problem ). In general terms, these weights normally represent the
            strength of the interconnection between neurons inside the artificial neural
            network. All the weighted inputs are summarized inside the computing unit.</p>
        <br>
        <p>If the weighted sum is equal to zero, then bias is added to make the output
            non-zero or something else to scale up to the system&#39;s response. Bias has the
            same input, and weight equals to 1. Here the total of weighted inputs can be
            in the range of 0 to positive infinity. Here, to keep the response in the limits of
            the desired value, a certain maximum value is benchmarked, and the total of
            weighted inputs is passed through the activation function.</p>  
        <br>
        <p>The activation function refers to the set of transfer functions used to achieve
            the desired output. There is a different kind of the activation function, but
            primarily either linear or non-linear sets of functions. Some of the commonly
            used sets of activation functions are the Binary, linear, and Tan hyperbolic
            sigmoidal activation functions.</p>
